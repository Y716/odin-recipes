    <h1>Rendang</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade Rendang recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
        A more traditional homemade Rendang filling would be made with 
        ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage 
        cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a 
        leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 pound lean ground beaf</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
